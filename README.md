## 🚨 The Problem: Discharge is Broken

In high-pressure hospitals like those in Manhattan or Paris, **discharge delays** are common due to:

- Fragmented handoffs between doctors, nurses, billing, and pharmacy  
- Manual summaries and checklists  
- No centralized system to track readiness or progress

These gaps lead to:

- ❌ Bed Shortages  
- 😫 Staff Burnout  
- 💸 Higher Patient Costs  
- ⏳ Poor Hospital Efficiency

More than a chatbot — it’s an **autonomous digital staff member** that:

- Detects when a patient is ready for discharge  
- Plans and delegates tasks (labs, meds, billing, transport)
